40,"Almost 1month of purshase and i am loving it . Great for photography and videography and trust me the stability of video is awesome . High end performence in Gaming , the only problem is that it heats up a little while playing Bgmi but if u play in a AC room then there's no issue .The boxy look of iphone 12 is very good and it gives a premium feel while holding . worth buying . also if you are confused between iph 11 or iph12 then close your eyes and go for iphone 12 ."

63,"It’s my first iPhone ever and I bought it with my earned money through part time jobs in college✌️I am a tech freak so you can trust my views -- A14 Bionic is the fastest, most efficient and reliable processor till date- The camera focuses so quickly that you can take DSLR quality photos.- The screen size 6.1 inches is the most comfortable screen size out there and the OLED retina XDR display is so crisp and everything feels real.- The stereo speakers are so clear even on high volume an..."

66,"It is my first iphone bought in bbd sale. Acc to me it is most value for money compare to others phone, everything is good display,sound,performance,everything except battery which is average acc to me. I charged my iphone 12 with 20W charger when my battery comes down to 40% and remove it from charging when it reaches to 80%. It takes about 30 min to charge it. My battery heath is still 100% acc to me which is good👍👍Here are some samples taken by me in iphone12🥰"

71,This was an awesome buy. I bought this phone for my father who was upgrading from an iPhone 6. He is very happy with this phone. The size is really good. He said that it was even more comfortable to hold than the 6 as it had flat sides. It is Smaller than most android phones but big enough for anything and everything.The performance is Stellar. You won't notice any lag and it's very fast. Ram management is good too. And the phone stays at a reasonable temperature even when using Gmaps. Th...

83,This was my second iphone after the xr and i can say there’s a lot of difference in day to day tasks. First of all here are some pros• Amazing camera with very good nightmode. • Performance is top notch. • No heating issue like other phones while performing daily   tasks. • The design is very handy and gives a premium feel in hand. Now the cons• Battery is sufficient but could be better but it’s ok for a medium user. • only one con bro that’s iphone there’s no complaint 😎.
84,Nice
85,"I would use the Old Commercial tagline of Apple to describe it in one line, “If You Don’t have an iPhone, Well You Don’t have an iPhone”.          P.S - I have uploaded Outdoor, Indoor, Day light and Night Pictures to show the Magnificent Camera Quality."

87,"iPhone 6S Plus 64GB -> iPhone 12 128GBMy 2nd iPhone, upgraded after 5 years.Gorgeous display, stunning new blue colour, excellent camera, best hardware-software combination, that’s how I would describe iPhone 12 as a package. 😊Even though my previous iPhone had a 5.5” display and this one has 6.1” display, its overall body size is much smaller. Had to get used to it initially 🙂Opening/closing/loading of apps is fast. No issues there. Video playback on this screen looks gorgeous. Took..."

89,"The phone is amazing, i switched to iphone after 3 years from one plus 6. I am certainly feeling why iphones people buy."
90,"Switched from Android to iPhone and this transition was really smooth due to its easier GUI. I bought this 128 Gb variant and Didn’t waited for iPhone 13 as iPhone 12 has all ,what one need in a perfect phone. In person white colour seems much sexier than purple and black. Attached pics for the reference.1.OLED Screen is good but by default its much of a warmer tone.You can disable the True tone option.Dark mode is lit 🔥🔥2.Battery 🔋 lasts a day with Wifi ,location and Mobile Data on. Go..."
91,"Nothing to say about this device. Absolutely flawless. Premium in-hand feel. Nothing to say about the camera. Surround sound works absolutely fine. A14 Bionic is just flawless. Smooth multi tasking. This is my first big upgrade to any flagship device and the usage is mesmerizing. Im literally impressed. Used 5s and 6s years ago, but nothing comes infront of this! Can blindly go for this device. Kudos to Flipkart and their next day delivery policy. Open box policy is also impressive. Go for it."
92,"This is my 1st Apple product and I must say it's a beast of a device 🔥It handle everything in a very smooth ways, it's buttery smooth 😌I'm just loving this device and I must say iphones have something unique in them which everyone must try out❤️I will write my detailed review after using it for 2 months."

99,"I recently upgraded to the iPhone 12 and I have no regrets. The phone is very sleek, streamlined and svelte looking, especially in the red color, which I prefer.The phone works flawlessly, with great audio and a decent speaker, for voice or music. The text feature, likewise, is extremely easy to use and intuitive. The phone takes excellent pictures, rivaling many stand-alone cameras and equipment, and the panoramic feature is very useful and cool. The other apps work great as well and open q..."
